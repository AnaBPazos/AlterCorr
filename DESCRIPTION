Description: This package calculate the correlations between two variables or matrices 
    or dataframes, for four independence coefficients; Pearson correlation, 
    Maximum Information Coefficient (MIC), Random dependency coefficient (RDC) 
    and Correlation of distances (dCor). These coefficients differ from the 
    Pearson correlation in that they detect non-linear dependencies and are not 
    subject to the normality of the data. Together with the correlations, calculate 
    the p-values and the adjusted p-values for each type of coefficient. When the 
    function is used for matrices and dataframes, the difference between the 
    calculation of paired data (must have the same dimensions) or independent 
    (they must only coincide in the same number of columns).
